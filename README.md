# coding_challenge-20

This coding challenge is all about **Building the BEST CSS ANIMATION IN THE WORLD!!**. This month we are going to have fun with some creative CSS animation work. Don't worry, I am going to give you some excellent resources for this challenge so that EVERYBODY can participate. You just need to know basic HTML and CSS for this one. 


## What is the Challenge? 
All you have to do for this challenge, is to create and HTML file (index.html), and a CSS file (style.css) which displays the text "ZTM Family" in the most unique way possible using CSS animations! Sounds simple doesn't it? Well, just to give you some inspiration, [here is a link to my favourite resource when doing CSS animations](https://codemyui.com/tag/text-animation/). Use it as an insipiration or even just copy the CSS of the effect you like best! The most creative entry will receive the below prize!

## Prizes!!
The most creative 3 entries will receive any one of my current Udemy courses of choice for free! Winners will be announced a week after the coding challenge ends!

At the end of the challenge, we will post everyone's custom "ZTM Family" text page down below so make sure you read below for the submission guidelines (In *The Rules Are* section)!

## Submissions:

*submissions will be posted at the end of the month!*

## The Rules Are:

1. **You have until August 30st at 11:59pm EST** to submit your solution (using Github. If you don't know how to do that, check out the lecture in the Git + Github section of the course). You will have to submit the link to the **#coding-challenge** Discord group with the following message:  *-challenge URL LINK TO YOUR ENTRY"* . The bot will listen for the command and will reply with "thanks for your submission" if it succeeded.

2. Use whatever tools you have as developers (google, friends, Discord, programming buddy etc...) but I will not be offering any help with this challenge. Just like a developer, you must solve a problem and build something that will be challenging. Nobody will hold your hand during the job so we want to experience that by figuring it all out on your own with your team. 

## One Last Thing!

**Please note: As with all my challenges there is zero benefit or monetary gain I recieve from it. This is just my way of thanking my students and making sure that you are able to continue gaining valuable knowledge outside of just my videos. It would mean a lot to me if you are able to rate my course...5 star reviews make my day :)**
